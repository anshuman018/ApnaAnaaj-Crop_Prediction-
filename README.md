## Features
- Predicts prices for around 23 commodities (including all types of crops) with high accuracy.
- Provides detailed crop forecasting up to the next 12 months.
- Lists top gainers and losers among crops in real-time.
- Crop price prediction accuracy ranges between 93-95%.
- Trained on authenticated datasets provided by [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in).
- Provides detailed price analysis through tables and charts.
- Uses advanced machine learning models like Decision Tree Regression.
- Factors in annual rainfall data and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for better accuracy.
- Intuitive and user-friendly UI designed with MaterializeCSS.
- Responsive and suitable for desktop and mobile views.

### Tech Stack
- [Python (3.0 or above)](https://www.python.org/): Core language used for the backend logic and model implementation.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): Lightweight web framework for serving the web application.
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): Machine learning library for training and implementing regression models.
- [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/): Frontend CSS framework used to create responsive designs.
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/): For data visualization and creating dynamic charts.
